# README

This project allows you to create a user, channels, and chat concurrently! There are also fun message reactions.

## Running locally

NOTE: This only runs on Node.js version 16 (sorry it's not very forward-thinking code). Please downgrade your node by using `nvm use v16`. The reason is because I'm using NeDB, which isn't maintained anymore.

- `yarn` — Installs dependencies
- `yarn start` — Starts the Webpack and Node servers
- `yarn client` — Starts the Webpack server
- `yarn server` — Starts the Node server

Alternatively, run 
- `npm start`
